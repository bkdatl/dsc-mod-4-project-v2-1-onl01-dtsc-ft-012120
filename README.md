# Module 4 Final Project - Recommendation System 


## Introduction

This project will be a comprehensive - highlevel overview of the development of a recommendation system. 

## Approach

- Data will be imported and cleaned 
- Certain values will be visualized to ensure accurace and identify patterns. 
- Very basic recommendation system will be built as proof of concerpt 
- Recommendation system will be built using cutting edge libraries and models 

## Data 
The data is split across 4 CSV files named the following: 

links.csv
movies.csv
ratings.csv
tags.csv

These can be expanded to show the following data columns: 

Links: movieId  imdbId   tmdbId
